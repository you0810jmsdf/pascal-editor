# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Features (N's factory fork)

- **Japanese building code (建築法規)** — a Pascal-free engine `@nsfactory/kenchiku` (`packages/kenchiku`) computes the 2025-04 wood-frame prescriptive checks (必要壁量 from loads, 風圧, 存在壁量, 四分割法, N値, 柱の小径), the non-structural site and room checks, and nine printable documents; `core` adds optional `jp` fields on site/building/wall/zone and a scene adapter; the editor gets a 建築法規 panel and a floor-plan overlay of bearing walls; agents get `jp_structural_check`, `jp_building_code_check`, `jp_set_wall_bearing`, `jp_get_document`. Results are design references that state their formula and legal source. See `wiki/architecture/kenchiku.md` and `docs/nsfactory/kenchiku-spec.md`.


### Breaking

- **`wall.assembly` is now F2 assembly layers** (breaking change to the additive plugin v1 contract; the WS5 shape shipped days earlier in #937). Walls store `{ layers: [{ id, role, thickness, core?, material?, … }], face?, presetId?, cavityInsulation? }` instead of `{ exterior, sheathing, framing, interior, preset }`. Scenes saved with the old shape are converted on load and at the scene API boundary, so `thickness` and every drawing stay the same. Plugins that read `wall.assembly.exterior` / `.framing` / `.preset` directly should read `wallAssemblyToLegacy(wall.assembly)` (the old shape, or `null` for a stack it cannot express), `wallAssemblyFraming(wall)` or `wallAssemblyExteriorFinish(wall)`; `WALL_ASSEMBLY_PRESETS[i].assembly` is F2 too.

## 1.0.0 (2026-09-12)

### Features

- Add plugin-contributed editor panels and viewer presentations with project-local configuration persistence.
- Include Environment in the standalone app's Plugins catalogue, with a pinned GitHub dependency and registered editor panel and viewer presentation.
- Refresh Environment's authoring controls and include its interactive color picker.
- Update Environment to its pinned global-visibility release, with a session-wide master control and isolation-aware presentation visibility.
- Expose generic atmosphere and ground-replacement adapters, Site-scoped floorplan output, bake-only GLB geometry, and plugin-owned selection materials.
- Add portable GLB/USDZ downloads with asynchronous material baking, procedural-content filters, and opt-in static viewer-presentation exports.
- **Public agent skills** — `pascal-3d` and `furniture-fit` teach MCP-capable agents to build, inspect, validate, and hand off scenes, and to report measured furniture footprints with evidence-scoped conclusions, fail-closed input gates, blocker-aware next actions, and an optional no-sign-in footprint pre-check link ([#777](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/777), [#781](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/781), [#791](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/791), [#794](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/794), [#824](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/824))
- **Plugin bundles 0.1.3 → 0.1.8** — the same canonical `skills/` source ships as one versioned plugin with a recorded validation ledger per bundle ([#782](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/782), [#795](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/795), [#802](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/802), [#811](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/811), [#825](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/825))
- **Claude Code and Codex plugin marketplaces** — this repository is installable as `pascal-agent-skills@pascal`, with a credential-free local `pascal mcp connect` server bundled for Claude Code ([#777](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/777), [#810](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/810))
- **Hosted MCP server in the Claude Code plugin** — `pascal-agent-skills@pascal` now also bundles a `pascal-hosted` Streamable HTTP server for `https://editor.pascal.app/api/mcp`, authenticated with an optional Pascal API key collected as sensitive plugin user configuration and stored in the OS keychain rather than any file ([#835](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/835))
- **OpenAI portable plugin manifest** — root `plugin.json` carries the Agent Plugins schema, listing metadata, branding assets, a With MCP review packet, and per-tool annotation justifications for all 46 MCP tools ([#796](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/796), [#797](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/797), [#799](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/799), [#812](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/812), [#813](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/813))
- **ClawHub publication readiness** — scoped `.clawhubignore` policies with regression tests that reject re-inclusion and legacy-override rules ([#798](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/798), [#806](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/806))
- **Official MCP Registry entry** — `io.github.pascalorg/editor` 0.6.1 publishes the hosted Streamable HTTP endpoint, with CI validating the manifest against the live API catalog ([#808](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/808), [#809](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/809))
- **Portable `mcp.json`, Cursor manifest, Gemini extension, plate logo** — Codex and Cursor now register the bundled MCP server (the spec reads root `mcp.json`, not `.mcp.json`); `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` and `gemini-extension.json` add those marketplaces; the MCP Registry entry gains `repository` and `icons`; marketplace logos use the brand mark on its `#171717` plate; `bun run skills:validate` asserts parity across every descriptor ([#829](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/829))
- **`pascal agent claim` and `pascal agent status`** — an agent can open a prefilled 15-minute human handoff and verify its hosted key without storing or printing it, shipped in the npm-published CLI ([#815](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/815), [#818](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/818), [#819](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/819), [#821](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/821), [#822](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/822))
- **Small CLI, downloaded web runtime** — `@pascal-app/cli` now installs from a 0.5 MB npm package instead of 65 MB: the MCP service ships inside it, so `pascal mcp connect` works with no editor process and no download, while the web editor runtime is fetched once per version from its release asset, verified against a SHA-256 digest published in the package, and installed atomically; `--runtime <directory-or-archive>` covers offline hosts, `HTTPS_PROXY`/`NO_PROXY` are honoured, and an editor started by a pre-split CLI keeps its own MCP child, which must be stopped once by hand after upgrading (#845)
- **Optional hosted key in the Cursor plugin** — `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` declares an optional `PASCAL_API_KEY` variable and points at a Cursor-dialect `.cursor-plugin/mcp.json` that adds a `pascal-hosted` server for `https://editor.pascal.app/api/mcp`, so a Cursor install can reach hosted projects, Capture scans, and shared workspaces while the credential-free local server keeps working; the portable `mcp.json` stays credential-free because Agent Plugins 1.0.0 forbids secrets and placeholder expansion in `headers`, so Codex configures the hosted endpoint with `codex mcp add --bearer-token-env-var PASCAL_API_KEY` instead ([#849](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/849))
- **Capture packages folded into core and viewer** — `@pascal-app/capture-protocol` is now `@pascal-app/core/capture` and `@pascal-app/capture-viewer` is now `@pascal-app/viewer/capture` (plus `@pascal-app/viewer/capture/preview`), so 1.0.0 ships seven packages instead of nine. Neither package was ever published to npm, so there is no npm migration; in-repo and workspace consumers change their import paths only.

### Fixes

- Preserve native and active presentation skies in snapshots and keep preset captures transparent.
- Localize terrain and ground-cover brush updates, preserve pending dab uploads, and keep Environment's day/night light graph stable.
- Keep Site-scoped floorplan overlays aligned with live move and rotation previews.
- Preserve Site ownership and same-kind sibling context in synchronous and asynchronous export geometry, including Site children without a parent ID.
- Exclude detached Site children and their descendants from visible-only exports when their owning Site is hidden, including children without a parent ID.
- Preserve unsaved presentation settings when a project receives its first ID, without overwriting an existing project's stored configuration.
- Avoid native TypeScript compiler inference overflow in atmosphere fog references without changing rendering.
- Omit stale viewer-surroundings selections from GLB/USDZ downloads after a presentation is unregistered or its plugin is uninstalled.
- Keep export settings scrollable and group advanced model options in a keyboard-accessible disclosure.
- Preserve child geometry when exporting empty mesh containers to USDZ.
- Export the viewer's shadow-only layer for plugin consumers.
- Remove the nonworking god-ray post-process and its dedicated viewer API; preserve sky, fog, lighting, and ordinary shadows.
- Preserve grass and procedural material colors in portable exports; freeze instancing and deformation without changing the live scene or saved-viewer animation clips.
- Stop registered placement tools when their plugin is uninstalled in either view, preserving authored nodes and requiring explicit reactivation after reinstall.
- Include enabled, visible Site contributions below architecture in floorplan PDFs, preserving building transforms, inline images, and even-odd holes. Hidden Sites also hide children associated through their declared child list.
- The Claude Code plugin root is now `skills/` instead of the repository root, so installing `pascal-agent-skills@pascal` copies the two skill bundles and their MCP configuration instead of caching the whole monorepo and running `bun install` against the root lockfile ([#832](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/832))
- Preserve custom scene materials across save, load, clone, fork, and live sync. Materials were dropped at every persistence boundary, so a scene reopened with default surfaces. Collections were dropped on MCP import for the same reason ([#597](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/597)) by [@ShiroKSH](https://github.com/ShiroKSH)
- Wall junction mitering is now deterministic for exactly-collinear walls, so identical scenes produce identical geometry regardless of node iteration order ([#596](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/pull/596)) by [@tomatotomata](https://github.com/tomatotomata)

### Packages

All seven public packages are published as `1.0.0` under the npm `latest`
dist-tag: `core`, `viewer`, `editor`, `nodes`, `mcp`, `ifc-converter`, and
`cli`. `@pascal-app/capture-protocol` and `@pascal-app/capture-viewer` were
folded into `@pascal-app/core/capture` and `@pascal-app/viewer/capture` before
the release and were never published.

**Full changelog**:
https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/compare/v1.0.0-beta.1...v1.0.0

## 1.0.0-beta.1 (2026-07-30)

The first Pascal Editor 1.0 beta. Relative to
[v0.9.1](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/releases/tag/v0.9.1), this release
focuses the editor around a stable extensible scene model and production-grade
architectural workflows.

### Highlights

- **Terrain sculpting** — raise, lower, flatten, and smooth a compact height field with a persistent brush, live grid feedback, subtle continuous sound, undo-safe strokes, terrain raycasting, and first-person collision.
- **Terrain-aware construction** — walls, slabs, stairs, fences, columns, items, and other floor-placed nodes resolve stacked support and update live while terrain is sculpted. Wall and slab foundations can fill down to terrain without changing authored height or thickness.
- **Vertical modeling** — stored storey heights, raised-support drafting, explicit elevation anchors and guides, slab/deck stacking, auto-room surface elevation, wall/ceiling clamps, and support-aware placement above or below slabs.
- **Plugin and node architecture** — public node definitions, the built-in nodes package, plugin management, host integration primitives, and first-party Nature and MEP workflows.
- **Floor-plan and export workflows** — faster navigation, contextual dimensions and modes, more reliable placement and selection, textured GLB plus STL/OBJ export, capture framing, and hardened bake/walkthrough paths.
- **Rendering and interaction quality** — grounded lighting, safer WebGPU/WebGL fallbacks, deterministic snapping, group manipulation, improved camera/compass synchronization, and resilient legacy-scene migration.

### Packages

All public packages are published as `1.0.0-beta.1` under the npm `beta`
dist-tag. Stable `latest` installations remain on the 0.x line during the beta.
