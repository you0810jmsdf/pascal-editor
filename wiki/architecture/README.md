# Architecture

Canonical rules for code that touches `packages/core`, `packages/viewer`, `packages/editor`, `packages/nodes`, `packages/mcp`, or `apps/editor`. Read on demand from `AGENTS.md` and from `.agents/skills/review-architecture/SKILL.md`.

## Pages

| Page | Covers |
|---|---|
| [layers](layers.md) | Three.js layer constants, ownership, and rendering separation |
| [systems](systems.md) | Core and viewer systems architecture |
| [renderers](renderers.md) | Registry renderer dispatch and the custom `def.renderer` contract |
| [node-definitions](node-definitions.md) | Three-checkbox composition model for registry-driven kinds (`geometry` / `renderer` / `system`) |
| [materials-and-themes](materials-and-themes.md) | Surface colour: surface roles, colour presets, the textures axis, and scene themes (appearance / ground / clay tints) |
| [item-authoring](item-authoring.md) | Content-author contract for catalog item GLBs: `slot_` material naming, authored defaults + `pascal_material` extras, the `cutout` reserved mesh, UV world scale, and the validated Blender/export recipe |
| [plugin-authoring](plugin-authoring.md) | Public contract for external plugins — `Plugin` shape, `setPluginDiscovery`, lifecycle, what's in and out of v1 |
| [tools](tools.md) | Editor tools structure, 2D↔3D behavioral parity, manipulation constraints, and the snapping rule (Shift taps cycle the mode, Alt hold forces) |
| [agent-surfaces](agent-surfaces.md) | MCP ↔ hosted AI chat ↔ published skill parity: shared contracts and operations, knowledge parity, tells of drift |
| [authored-objects](authored-objects.md) | Items an agent writes as three.js: script source, artifacts, naming conventions, surfaces, clips, compile hosts |
| [measurements](measurements.md) | Persistent measurement data, 2D/3D draft ownership, snapping, units, and visibility |
| [interaction-scope](interaction-scope.md) | The authoritative interaction state machine ("the spine"): `InteractionScope` union, the begin/update/end/endIf contract, the raycast hot-set, and the overlay scope matrix |
| [viewer-isolation](viewer-isolation.md) | Keeping `@pascal-app/viewer` editor-agnostic |
| [capture-runtime](capture-runtime.md) | Open capture protocol, host source boundary, static/live viewer layers, and stream extension |
| [selection-managers](selection-managers.md) | Two-layer selection (viewer + editor), events, outliner |
| [selection-groups](selection-groups.md) | Session multi-select groups (Ctrl/Cmd+G), expand-on-click, how they differ from collections |
| [scene-registry](scene-registry.md) | Global node ID → Object3D map and `useRegistry` |
| [spatial-queries](spatial-queries.md) | Placement validation (`canPlaceOnFloor`/`Wall`/`Ceiling`) for tools |
| [node-schemas](node-schemas.md) | Zod schema pattern for node types, `createNode`, `updateNode` |
| [inspector-field-limits](inspector-field-limits.md) | When a numeric inspector field may and may not have `min`/`max` — no arbitrary caps on dimensions |
| [vertical-model](vertical-model.md) | Stored level heights, plane-bound wall/ceiling tops, slab placement + thickness, support hosts, clamp rules, and the load migration |
| [wall-frame](wall-frame.md) | Wall reference line and justification (`a` / `b` / Center), lateral offsets owned by `wall-frame.ts` |
| [space-detection](space-detection.md) | Commit and replication contract for wall-driven room reconciliation |
| [kenchiku](kenchiku.md) | Japanese building-code engine (`@nsfactory/kenchiku`), the scene adapter, persisted `jp` fields, the 建築法規 panel and the `jp_*` agent tools (N's factory fork) |
| [events](events.md) | Typed event bus — emitting and listening to node and grid events |

## Reading order for an architecture review

1. [layers](layers.md), [systems](systems.md), [renderers](renderers.md), [tools](tools.md), [viewer-isolation](viewer-isolation.md) — required every review.
   - When the diff touches placement / move / handle / reshape / box-select / paint or any overlay or picking behaviour, also read [interaction-scope](interaction-scope.md).
2. The remaining pages on demand, based on what the diff touches.
